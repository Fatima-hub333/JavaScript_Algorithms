Active Record acts as the translator between Ruby & SQL. So, when a request comes from the controller to the model, the model then uses Active Record to speak to the database.

Why is understanding Active Record Important?

All the syntax such as {User.first} and {user.find(1)} are methods brought to us by Active Record. Active record comes prebuilt with a tremendous amount of features and methods we can use, many of which you may already be using. As such, understanding what is made avilable through Active Record not only makes you a better Rails developer, it also gives you many ways to gather data without having to write them yourself.

Models & tables are just two of the many things Rails connects for you if proper naming conventions are used.
