Insertion sort is a simple algorithm that works well on small inputs, but it's too slow for large-scale sorting. Quick sort is a more efficient algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.

Knowing different sorting algorithms will help you in your daily life as a programmer and is crucial during job interviews.

The quick sort technique is done by separating the list into two parts. Initially, a pivot element is chosen by partitioning algorithm. The left part of the pivot holds the smaller values than the pivot, and right part holds the larger value. After partitioning, each separate lists are partitioned using the same procedure.

The Complexity of Quicksort Technique:
- Time complexity: O(n log n) for best case and average case, O(n^2) for the worst case.
- Space Complexity: O(log n)

Algorithm:
Partition(array, lower, upper)
How to create a cover letter that expands upon your resume to paint a thorough picture of who you are as both a potential employee and as a person. It doesn't need to be perfect. Focus on using the curriculumn to write the first version and submit it for review. You'll receive feedback that you'll be able to use to make improvements.

{Why is a strong Cover letter so Important?}
For as long as human beings have existed, we've told each other stories. Our societies are built on stories, and good stories can help even strangers feel like they already know you. That's the purpose of a cover letter: to tell a story of who you are, why you're a strong job candidate, and why you'd be an exceptional employee/ 

Most Cover letters do nothing but summarize a person's job experiences, which wastes the opportunity to talk about what makes you special. A strong cover letter, however, is an opportunity to frame your experiences and professional strengths, and to explain why you would make a better prspective hire than any other job applicant in an application pile. This project will walk you through how to write a cover letter designed to tell a compelling story that showcases your professional strengths and uniqueness, regardless of your previous experience.

{Coverletter Header}
You cover letter header is intended to quickly link hiring managers to you online presence: particularly your portfolio, contact information, and professional online profiles. That's why, a hiring  manager won't have to toggle between documents in order to find a method of contacting you, but instead will always have your name, contact info, and professional links easily accessible. 

{What should you add to your cover letter header?}
Every document you submit for a job application should contain your name and contact info, and your cover letter is no different: at the very least, your header should contain contact information relevant professional links, such as links to your portfolio, linkedin, Github. This is to make sure that the hiring manager always has easy access to important sites like your portfolio, and will never have to search through multiple documents in order to lacte the link they're looking for.

{Goal of the Cover Letter}
The goal of a cover letter is two fold: to show not only why you'd be a good fit for this specific job, but also why your personality would be a good fit for this specific team. Your cover letter shouldn't just be a rephrasing of your resume. it should tell the story of how your skillset contributed to your accomplishments.
