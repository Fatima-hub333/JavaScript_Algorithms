The running times of linear search & binary search include the time needed to make and check guesses, but there is more to these algorithms.

"The running time of an algorithm depends on how long it takes a computer to run the lines of code of the algorithm, and that depends on the speed of the computer, the programming lanugage, and the complier that translates the program from the programming language into code that runs directly on the computer, among other factors.

Lets think about the running time of an algorithm more carefully. We can use a combination of two ideas. 
1- First, we need to determine how long the algorithm takes, in terms of the size of its input. We think about the running time of the algorithm as a 'function of the size of its input.'

2- The second idea is that we must focus on how fast a function grows with the input size. We call this the 'rate of growth' of the running time. 
To keep things manageable, we need to simplify the function to distill the most important part and cast aside the less important parts.
